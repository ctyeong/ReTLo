# Learning local behavioral sequences to better infer non-local properties in real multi-robot systems
---
By Taeyeong Choi, Sehyeok Kang, and Theodore P. Pavlic

## Introduction 
This is 

## Prerequisite

- Python v3.6
- Tensorflow v1.14
- Jupyter Notebook v5.7.8
- Tested in Google's official docker image avilable at [Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker)


## Datasets

We attach ThymioL, a dataset specialized for RTL problem. 
The dataset provides global coordinates and orientation of each real *Thymio* robot, and the recording occured twice per second. 
There are two separate cases based on the size of the robot team, one with 3 robots and the other with 5 robots. 
All robots followed motion rules defined in
